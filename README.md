## Project : Instrument Changer
- `Sound Change` directory has this project.
- The aim of this project is to convert the audio clip of one instrument to the audio clip of other instrument.
- To do that we need to do the following :
    - First we need to have the input audio file as `input.mp3` in audio folder
    - Now we need to convert it to the midi file using `Code/audio_to_midi.py`
    - Now we need to combine this midi file with the Sound font of the desired instrument.
    - Now finally we need to generate the output audio file from the above files using `Code/midi_to_audio.py`.
    - Output will be stored as `audio/output.mp3`.
